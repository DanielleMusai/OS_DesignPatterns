# OS_DesignPatterns

## Part A - isPrime
The isPrime function determines whether a given unsigned integer is prime or not.

## Part B - Queue Implementation
The queue and node structures, along with their associated functions, provide a basic queue implementation used in the pipeline.

## Part C - Active Object Implementation
The activeObject structure and its associated functions implement the concept of active objects, which are responsible for executing tasks asynchronously.

## Part D - st_pipeline 
This repository contains a program called st_pipeline that demonstrates the usage of the functions provided in the previous sections. The program builds a pipeline consisting of four active objects (aos) to process a series of numbers and perform specific tasks on them.

### Pipeline Structure


*func1:

Initializes the random number generator using the given seed.
Generates N random numbers, each consisting of six digits (e.g., 3 + 3).
Enqueues each number into the queue of the next active object (ao2) with a time difference of one thousandth of a second.

*func2:

Receives numbers from ao1's queue.
Prints each number, checks if it is prime, and prints "true" or "false" accordingly.
Adds 11 to the number and enqueues it into ao3's queue.

*func3:

Receives numbers from ao2's queue.
Prints each number, checks if it is prime, and prints "true" or "false" accordingly.
Subtracts 13 from the number and enqueues it into ao4's queue.

*func4:

Receives numbers from ao3's queue.
Prints each received number.
Adds 2 to the number and prints the new number.
If everything is implemented correctly, the last number printed by ao4 will be equal to the first number generated by ao1.
The pipeline demonstrates the flow of data between active objects, where each object performs a specific task on the input and passes the result to the next object in the pipeline.
